# evolutional-nn
Module for creating and evolving neural networks

## Resources
The library was built to work with [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.
[python-mnist](https://pypi.org/project/python-mnist/) data parser was used to load the dataset.

## Usage example
See `main.py` which demonstrates evolving neural networks for digit classification.
